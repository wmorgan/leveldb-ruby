INSTALLATION

  gem install leveldb-ruby

SYNOPSIS

  require 'rubygems' # on for ruby 1.8
  require 'leveldb'

  ## make a new database or open an existing one
  ## this creates a directory with the specified path containing multiple files
  db = LevelDB::DB.new "/tmp/asdf"

  ## getting and setting
  ## leveldb keys and values must be strings
  ## arbitrary byte arrays can be stored by first encoding them as strings
  db.put "it", "works"               # => "works"
  db.get "it"                        # => "works"

  db["hello"] = "there"              # => "there"
  db["hello"]                        # => "there"

  db["nonexistent"]                  # => nil

  ## testing
  db.includes? "hello"               # => true
  db.contains? "hello"               # => true

  ## keys and values
  db.keys                            # => "it", "hello"
  db.values                          # => "there", "works"

  ## iterating
  db.each { |k, v| ... }
  db.map { |k, v| ... }
  db.each                            # => LevelDB::Iterator

  ## ranges
  db.each(:from => "a", :to => "b")  # => LevelDB::Iterator
  db.each(:from => "a", :to => "b").
    map { |k, v| ... }
  # etc...

  ## deleting key/value pairs
  db.delete "hello"       # => "there"
  db.delete "hello"       # => nil

  ## to delete the database remove the directory and its contents
